# Comet - Alpha v0.2.0
Phase 1 of Project Comet - Importing pictures, processing and exporting data to CSV

Requires the following modules
CSV (fairly self-explanatory, I used the default python included CSV package)
OS (for interaction with folders and file management)
numpy (for pixel calculations and array manipulations)
opencv (for image processing)

All functions have been compiled into the comet v2.py script
Just place an image to analyze in the ingest folder and run script and the program will place output files in the output folder
