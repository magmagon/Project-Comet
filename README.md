# Comet - V1
Phase 1 of Project Comet - Importing pictures, processing and exporting data to CSV

Requires the following modules
CSV (fairly self-explanatory, I used the default python included CSV package)
OS (for interaction with folders and file management)
numpy (for pixel calculations)
scikit-image (wonderful collection of various image manipulation tools https://scikit-image.org/)

Usage:
1. Put the image to be processed within the ingest folder and run ALPHA.py (or blobby.py)
2. The processed image will be put in the temporary folder (which will be overwritten), the numerical results will be written to the output folder

Debug:
Coming soon...


Food tip 1: Frozen grapes are a delicious and healthy dessert for hot summer days, of which my hometown experiences many.
